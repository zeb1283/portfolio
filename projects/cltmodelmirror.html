 <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Model in the Mirror was a research project I completed with the Center for Language and Technology at UH Manoa under a Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) grant. The purpose was to develop a script that creates “C-tests,” which are language learning passages that the Center will use for an app that they are developing. I had an advisor to assist me with project direction, but all code was written by me.</p>

<p><img class="img-fluid" src="../img/modelmirrorpromo.png" width="200" height="200" /></p>

<h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>
<p>The script does the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Takes a text sample from most text formats (txt, pdf, epub, etc).</li>
  <li>Inputs this text into OpenAI’s ChatCompletion API with a prompt asking the model to generate 5 new passages from the base text.</li>
  <li>Places the output into a list for processing.</li>
  <li>Queries the model again and modifies the passage to a difficulty level and language the user inputs.</li>
  <li>Queries the model to categorize the passage from a list of single-word topics.</li>
  <li>Places the passage into a .json database for long-term storage.</li>
  <li>Uses spaCy NLP to separate the passage into sentences, and then tokens.</li>
  <li>Surrounds the second half of every second word with astrixes, excluding the first sentence, proper nouns, numbers, and punctuation (as punctuation is a token).</li>
  <li>Recombines the tokens into a string and sends the output to another .json file.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="lessons">Lessons</h2>
<p>In the process of developing this script, I developed a wide range of useful skills. I learned about the intricacies of type conversion, string manipulation, managing Python libraries, github file management, language processing, and more that would turn this sentence into a massive run-on. I also learned a lot about linguistics and the way by which spaCy processes and analyzes the text. The experience I gained by developing a project like this was invaluable and I can’t wait to continue working on it over the course of this semester.</p>

<h2 id="links-and-viewing-guide">Links and Viewing Guide</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/llcit/model-mirror" title="llcit/model-mirror">This is a link</a> to the repository where all files are stored. The current main prompt generator is stored in the “generators” folder under newgenerator.py. There is also a file called pipeline.py that generates a C-test from a random passage within a database. spacyfunctions.py is where the actual C-test conversion takes place. The last main file to highlight is doc_thoughts.ipnyb, which is a Jupyter notebook documenting the production of the project. Additionally, <a href="https://hushed-spiny-scaffold.glitch.me" title="H5P example">this is a sample website</a> that was used for language experts to test the C-tests.</p>
