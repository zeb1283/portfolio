 <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><a href="https://helunamanoa.info">Heluna Manoa</a> is a meteor web application built by a group of five. It has a fully functional interface and a backend database that utilizes MongoDB. The main functionality is that is allows users to rate university courses and the professors that teach them. It was done over a 4 week timespan, and involved certain milestones that allowed us to to keep on track throughout the process.</p>

<h2 id="lessons">Lessons</h2>
<p>Throughout the course of this project, I learned a lot about collaborative development and web development. Before this, I had no experience working with web applications, other than building simple pages using html. The vast majority of this project was done using JavaScript and JSX, so it was a new experience working with that. Using React was easier than I expected and most things worked fairly intuitively.</p>

<p>I was primarily responsible for working with the collections and input forms, such as writing a review or inputting a professor. This was what I asked to do, as I enjoy working with databases and figuring out ways to make them easier to interact with.</p>

<p>I also thought that my group worked well together and it was fun to be able to collaborate with one another. We were able to divide up different parts of the project and communicate when there were any conflicts between these parts. Overall, it was a very positive experience and Iâ€™m glad I got to take part in development.</p>
