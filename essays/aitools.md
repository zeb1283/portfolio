## Introduction

When generative AI like ChatGPT was first introduced around a year ago, I almost immediately began playing with it. I started with creating short poems about random topics, and expanding those into stories. Before long, I realized that it was an incredibly powerful tool that could assist with almost any computational task I put it through. To me, generative AI is incredible as a personal assistant, but should not be used as a work replacement.

## Personal Experience with AI

In the beginning, when we were first learning JavaScript, I committed to not using ChatGPT at all to replace any experience in my learning process. I enjoy being able to work with a new language and the challenges that came with it. However, when the class was first working with HTML and CSS, I couldn't find the same joy in solving issues. After that, I began using AI to help create templates that I could work off of instead of producing everything from scratch. I did this within the experiences, practice WODs, and in-class WODs.

However, I never wanted to use it on essays. I consider my voice to be one of the most valuable parts of any essay that I produce, so using an AI to replace that would feel disingenuous. I have also never really used AI to learn, as I prefer to learn through more traditional means rather than having AI regurgitate information that may not even be correct. With all of this in mind, here is a list:

- Experience WODs e.g. E18
Yes, in the cases described above. An example prompt would be: Write the outline for code that could display an h2 header with text "History of Web Browsers" and an image.
- In-class Practice WODs
Yes, same case as above.
- In-class WODs
Yes, same case as above, but typically with further use and prompt refinement after the fact.
- Essays
Never as explained above.
- Final project
Yes, mostly for debugging purposes. The scope of the project is too large to really do any form of code generation outside of a very limited function.
- Learning a concept / tutorial
Almost never for this class.
- Answering a question in class or in Discord
Never, I didn't really try to answer too many questions.
- Asking or answering a smart-question
Never, same reason as above.
- Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
Never, I could generally come up with them  myself.
- Explaining code
Never, I think that I'm generally pretty good at figuring out what code does.
- Writing code
Yes, mainly for HTML and CSS.
- Documenting code
Never, I probably should as I'm pretty bad at documenting things.
- Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code ____” or “Fix the ESLint errors in _____”
Yes, very often. I find this to be the most valuable case of using ChatGPT in the coding area.
- Other uses in ICS 314 not listed
Not particularly.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding

I believe that if anything, AI has probably hurt my learning and understanding. While I do believe that it is a massive timesaver, I think that the value that comes from truly solving a problem completely on my own is huge. It is just incredibly difficult to restrain myself from using AI tools because I do have so much on my plate.

With all that being said, however, I do believe that it hasn't hurt my core understanding of software engineering concepts. I think that because I had previous understanding of programming and software engineering before ChatGPT was introduced, I still am able to solve problems without it. It'll just take a while longer and be a whole lot more painful.

## Practical Applications

Because generative AI has become the global phenomenon it has, I have no doubt that it has many practical applications outside of this classroom. While I do think that the use of AI has to be monitored within the real world, I do believe that it has its place.

For example, someone cannot input company code directly into a generative AI software. That would be a severe security breach that would get anyone fired. However, I do believe that someone in the same situation could pose a question based on the material and not disclose any confidential or sensitive information.

## Challenges and Opportunities

While generative AI was a large help in many aspects of this class, there were definitely some severe limitations to its usefulness. The first would be the incorrect answers it provides regularly. One of the greatest skills one can have when working with AI is realizing when the answer it gives is incorrect, and altering that answer when it is.

I also believe that another important challenge with AI is knowing when to prioritize learning and when to prioritize productivity. Utilizing AI will almost always be more productive, but it can also limit the learning opportunity that can be gained from completing a task without it.

## Comparative Analysis

I believe that traditional teaching will almost always outshine AI approaches. Whenever I "learn" from AI, it is almost always short-term knowledge. There is always a guarantee that the AI will still be there to ask the same question.

While I have not tried to look at AI through a learning lens, I do believe that there may be some merit to AI-assisted learning, That is, traditional learning that uses AI as a tool to help with certain concepts. I am sure that there is probably something like that in development for use in Software Engineering education.

Practical skills are likely to suffer if there is an over-reliance on AI. Because so many simple errors can be fixed by AI, there tends to be a certain lack of care for developing those skills when working with AI.

## Future Considerations

I believe that AI, if used correctly, could become an invaluable tool in education. Educators must first understand how the AI works and have an in-depth knowledge of its flaws. They must then develop curriculum that addresses these issues and works around them.

Prompt engineering and design must also be considered when educating with and and about AI. As AI develops and becomes more accurate, this may become less necessary but for now it must be added. 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, artifical intelligence in its current form is a valuable tool that I have used many times in this course. I believe that having future experiences tailored towards prompt engineering would be very valuable for preparing students for the future of software engineering. Generative AI is never going to go away, and introducing students to best practices would be a great step towards improving their competency.
