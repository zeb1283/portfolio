JavaScript is a language that works flexibly as needed, how you want it to. Personally, it feels like a happy medium between Python and Java when actually writing it. It's like Python because data types don't need explicit declaration. At the same time, the semicolons and curly braces make it feel more like Java when writing. I was never a big fan of Python's lack of syntax like this, so it's nice to use again. The ability to modify arrays by pushing and unshifting is also great, as the static arrays in Java and C can be annoying for simple tasks. Object-oriented programming also seems straightforward, though I haven't explored it in depth yet.

As a complete beginner with JavaScript, it was very easy to pick up. Most things work intuitively as expected, which is definitely a plus coming from other languages. However, I do think that this can possibly be a double-edged sword. I think that JavaScript can allow the programmer to get away with a lot of things that make code less functional and messy.

Is JavaScript good from a software engineering view? I'd say yes, within its limitations. For web development, JavaScript is a great fit. However, it can't be the only language someone knows. For backend work, it's irrelevant (as it should be). JS isn't a generalist language, but it was never meant to be. It does exactly what it was designed for, so I'd call it a good programming language.

For learning JavaScript, ICS 314 uses "athletic software engineering" with frequent practice. This seems a useful way to learn, since syntax repetition is key no matter how advanced we get. The daily WODs aren't too stressful yet as we're still reviewing basics. But I anticipate more stress as the semester progresses. I'll be monitoring my progress in reading code snippets and writing efficient, understandable code. Both will be important for success in this class.
